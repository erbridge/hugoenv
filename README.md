# hugoenv

Inspired by [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and others, hugoenv is a
version manager for the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/).

It is very early software and comes with no guarantees.

**Note:** This has been developed on macos. It is likely not to work as expected
on other platforms. Pull requests to improve compatibility are welcome!
